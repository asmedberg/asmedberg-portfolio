This is the repo for my portfolio site. It is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and [Sanity.io](https://sanity.io).

This is a constant work in progress. I'll continue to add work and personal projects.

.env.local file should contain the following variables:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=your_dataset
```
